# Even More Players
This is an `Ultimate Chicken Horse` `BepInEx` mod that allows for more than 4 players to play local and online. WIP.
Works for UCH version 1.8.22, suport for the new patch 1.9.02 might take a while.

```
P2P: 100? players (maybe)
Unity Matchmaking: 8 players (limited by server side Unity Relay?)
```

All players need the mod.
The mod is disabled in normal Online play and only enabled when playing online via the "More" button.

Multiple players can select the same characters.
