fixed up in Loader.cs:

  class PlayerManager                                 maybe not needed if GameSettings.GetInstance().MaxPlayers is correct from the start                          
    maxPlayers
    playerList

  class LobbyManager
    lobbySlots
  
  class StatTracker

    saveFiles
  
  class NetworkLobbyManager
    m_MaxPlayers = 4;                                 ??? not patched yet ...
